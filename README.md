The Interactive Quiz Game is a single-page web application that displays one question at a time along with four possible answers. Each question is timed (15 seconds). If the user fails to answer within the time limit, the quiz automatically moves to the next question.

The application tracks the user’s score and displays the final result at the end of the quiz. The interface is clean, responsive, and user-friendly, making it suitable for learning, practice, and demonstrations.
